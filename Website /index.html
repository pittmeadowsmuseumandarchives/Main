      <h1>History</h1>
      <p>The Pitt Meadows General Store was constructed in 1886 and was moved to its current location in 1908. The store contained the community's first Post Office and the first telephone. The building was also used as a confectionary and social gathering place; families would catch up, leave messages for others, and exchange town gossip while they browsed through their mail and bought groceries.</p>
	  <p>In June of 1998, the Pitt Meadows Heritage and Museum Society moved in and the building became the new and permanent home of the Pitt Meadows Museum and Archives. </p>
	  <p>The Hoffmann family arrived in Pitt Meadows in 1934. They ran a machine shop and gas station, and in the later part of the 1940s, ventured into the ditching and drainage business. The "Son" of Hoffmann & Son was Hans Hoffmann. He was considered by many to be a technical genius. He designed and constructed much of the machinery in the shop, including his three highly innovative ditching machines. Hans was also the first fire Chief of Pitt Meadows and built the first fire truck. With the help of his sister, Elfriede Hoffmann, who ran the office and did the accounting, the Hoffmanns provided a valuable service to the farming community of Pitt Meadows, often repairing machinery at extremely low prices. </p>
      <p>In 1999, Hans and Freida Hoffmann donated the property, building, machinery, and Hans' collection of restored engines to the Pitt Meadows Heritage and Museum Society.</p>
